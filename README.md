## Features

- Track post publishing statistics per month and per year
- Lightweight and fast performance
- Clean and intuitive interface

## Install

Fetch the archive and download it as you would any WordPress plugin.

## Privacy

The plugin does not collect any data. It uses the current WordPress posts table to compute its statistics

## Next?

I don't really intend to update the code unless there's something really wrong with it or if I need anything else on top of what's already here.
Feel free to fork and use as you please.

## Donate

I put some of my free time into developing and maintaining this plugin.
