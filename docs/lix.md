# LIX

**The LIX score is a simple formula for measuring the difficulty level of written text.**

## What is the LIX score?

The LIX score (abbreviation from Lesbarhetsindex, meaning "Readability Index" in Swedish) is a simple and effective formula for measuring the difficulty level of written text. It was introduced by Carl-Hugo Björnsson in Sweden in the 1960s as a practical method to evaluate the readability of texts in school textbooks and the press. Unlike other more complex formulas, LIX has the advantage of being easy to calculate and applicable in multiple languages, including Romanian.

## How is the LIX score calculated?

The formula is:

**LIX = (total number of words / total number of sentences) + (number of long words × 100 / total number of words)**

Where:

- **Long words** are those that have more than 6 letters
- **Sentences** are delimited by final punctuation marks: `.`, `?`, `!`

For example, a text with 200 words, 10 sentences, and 50 long words will have:

**LIX = (200 / 10) + (50 × 100 / 200) = 20 + 25 = 45**

## How do we interpret the LIX score?

The LIX score can generally vary between 20 and 70, but in practice values can appear both higher and lower. Below you'll find a detailed interpretation by deciles, with typical examples:

| LIX | Difficulty | Text Type | Target Audience |
|-----|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| < 25 | Very easy | Books for small children | Children under 10, beginners |
| 25–30 | Easy | Children's stories, simple instructions | Children |
| 31–35 | Moderately easy | Light magazine articles, tourist brochures | General public |
| 36–40 | Accessible | User guides | Adults without technical training |
| 41–45 | Medium | Quality press, high school textbooks | High school students, university students |
| 46–50 | Difficult | Introductory academic texts, official reports | Educated public |
| 51–55 | Difficult | Academic essays, popular science books | Advanced readers |
| 56–60 | Very difficult | University textbooks, legal texts | Professionals |
| 61–65 | Extremely difficult | Philosophy, theory, dense documents | Specialists |
| > 65 | Practically unreadable | Archaic texts, administrative documents | Requires deep analysis |

## Key Components

The LIX formula considers two main factors:

1. **Average sentence length** (words per sentence) - Longer sentences increase complexity
2. **Percentage of long words** (words with more than 6 letters) - More complex vocabulary increases difficulty

## Applications

LIX is particularly useful for:

- **Educational content**: Matching text difficulty to student level
- **Publishing**: Ensuring content matches target audience reading level
- **Technical writing**: Simplifying complex documentation
- **Journalism**: Adapting articles for different readership levels
- **Web content**: Optimizing online text for accessibility

## Advantages of LIX

- **Simple calculation**: Easy to implement and understand
- **Language independent**: Works across multiple languages
- **Proven reliability**: Decades of successful use in education and publishing
- **Quick assessment**: Provides immediate readability feedback
